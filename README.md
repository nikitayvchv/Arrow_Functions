# Arrow Functions
### 2017/11/02

In order to try out arrow functions, I made a program which adds a different coloured circle everytime you click the screen. At first, my program was 18 lines of codes:

After I implimented the arrow function, I was able to get rid of the little "filler" function that would make a circle whenenever the canvas was clicked. There are probably easier ways of making this program without the need of even the arrow funciton, but for the purpose of learing I just made a very simple function. It ended up being 15 lines:

Allthough the code is very simple, and there isn't that much of a need for a => function in this program, I can see how in much bigger ones it would be useful, to avoid all of those small, one-line functions.

After watching the Sketpics Guide to Functional Style, I can agree that the definition for certain styles of coding and the usage of functions can varry from coder to coder, and everyone does their own thing. I can also agree that, as he said, certain functions can be pretty weird to look at, and aren't always going to be "the best thing to use" at that point in the program. When he was talking to the audience, there would be times where in order to answer a very simple question, you would have to look through the code a couple of times and keep track of multiple things. That can be pretty annoying to do in bigger programs, so the little tricks with different functions and different implimentations of functions can be pretty useful.
